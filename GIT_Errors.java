Links helped me while learning GIT Hub:

1. if we get 403 error while trying to push into new git hub account then follow this:

Go to: Control Panel -> User Accounts -> Manage your credentials -> Windows Credentials

Under Generic Credentials there are some credentials related to Github, Click on them and click "Remove".

and when you try to push something, you need to login again.

2.If you get the below:
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
